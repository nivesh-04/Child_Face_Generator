# Child_Face_Generator
The project started off with me learning about Basic terminal commands and how to operate GitHub through the terminal.
Next on the list of tasks was to understand python through the tutorials provided by the mentors.
I have almost completed the python tutorials which include understanding python Libraries like numpy.
The aim is to complete the Python tutorials within the few days after midsems and then continue to learn about Deep Learning and CNN through the courses that we have been enrolled in on Coursera.
