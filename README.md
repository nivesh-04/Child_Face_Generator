# Child_Face_Generator
The project started with me learning about Basic terminal commands and how to operate GitHub through the terminal.
Next on the list of tasks was to understand python through the tutorials provided by the mentors.
I have almost completed the python tutorials which include understanding python Libraries like NumPy.
The aim is to complete the Python tutorials within a few days after midsems and then continue learning about Deep Learning and CNN through the courses we have been enrolled in on Coursera.

With the approaching of the endsems, I aim to complete all the Coursera material within the 1st or 2nd week of July. After which I shall start working on the actual codebase of the Project. I also plan to continue working on the material that has been provided to me recently on Convoluted Neural Networks and GAN.
